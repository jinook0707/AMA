Alligatoridea Motion Analysis. Made for Stephan Reber's experiment.

An app made for a scientific experiment for testing behavioral predispositions of hatchlings of American alligator and spectacled caiman.
Basically color tracking app with capacity of accepting human manual input.
Human input was necessary due to the color tags could disappear depending on experimental condition, lighting condition and subject's postures.
